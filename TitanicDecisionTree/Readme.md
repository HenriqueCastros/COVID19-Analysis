# Titanic Dataset with Decision Tree
[<img src="https://cdn.activestate.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/kaggle-titanic-challenge.jpg" />](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

This is my take on the famous titanic dataset. My goal with this project **is not** to find the best model, it is only to learn and explore how to use a Decision Tree together with the Cross Validation implementation of SKLearn.

At the end of the notebook I also take a shot on creating Pipelines (Which, surprisingly, I managed to haha)

### Features to be developed
This project is complete. The tasks implemented were:

- [x] Simple data exploration and cleaning
- [x] Creating BaselineModel.
- [x] Finding best hiperparams.
- [x] Model Evaluation.
- [x] Creating Pipeline.

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, you will need a few tools, such as:

- Python, with Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn installed.
- Jupyter notebook, or another platform that allows to edit and vizualize a Python Notebook.
