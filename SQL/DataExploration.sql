/*
Data Exploration COVID-19
During this exploration, I'll explore different visualizations that are possible
with the datasets created.

The tables are named according to the names of the CSV files created. Please refer
to the README.md file available on my repository.

-- First look at the dataset CovidDeaths
Select *
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
Where continent is not null -- Avoiding data duplicated
order by 3,4


-- Selecting relvant columns

Select Location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
Where continent is not null 
order by 1,2


-- Total Cases vs Total Deaths
-- Possible to see of every country. In this case, I'm filtering Brazil
Select Location, date, total_cases,total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
Where location like '%Brazil%'
and continent is not null 
order by 1,2


-- Total Cases vs Population
Select Location, date, Population, total_cases,  (total_cases/population)*100 as PercentPopulationInfected
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
Where location like '%Brazil%'
order by 1,2

-- Highest Infection Count and Percent Population Infected by country
-- sorted descending 
Select Location, Population, MAX(total_cases) as HighestInfectionCount, Max((total_cases/population))*100 as PercentPopulationInfected
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
Where continent is not null 
Group by Location, Population
order by PercentPopulationInfected desc


-- Countries with Highest Death Count per Population
Select Location, MAX(cast(Total_deaths as int)) as TotalDeathCount
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
Where continent is not null 
Group by Location
order by TotalDeathCount desc

-- BREAKING THINGS DOWN BY CONTINENT
-- Showing contintents with the highest death count per population

Select continent, MAX(cast(Total_deaths as int)) as TotalDeathCount
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
Where continent is not null 
Group by continent
order by TotalDeathCount desc



-- GLOBAL NUMBERS
-- Possible to filter by country or date
Select SUM(new_cases) as total_cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int)) as total_deaths, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int))/SUM(New_Cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
--Where location like '%Brazil%'
where continent is not null 
--Group By date
order by 1,2



-- Total Population vs Vaccinations
-- Shows Percentage of Population that has recieved at least one Covid Vaccine

-- Firstly calculating query with own Total of people vaccinated 
Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations, 
SUM(CONVERT(int,vac.new_vaccinations)) OVER (Partition by dea.Location Order by dea.location, dea.Date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths dea
Join PortfolioProject..CovidVaccinations vac
	On dea.location = vac.location
	and dea.date = vac.date
where dea.continent is not null 
order by 2,3


-- Using CTE to perform Calculation on Partition By in previous query
With PopvsVac (Continent, Location, Date, Population, New_Vaccinations, RollingPeopleVaccinated)
as
(
Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations
, SUM(CONVERT(int,vac.new_vaccinations)) OVER (Partition by dea.Location Order by dea.location, dea.Date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths dea
Join PortfolioProject..CovidVaccinations vac
	On dea.location = vac.location
	and dea.date = vac.date
where dea.continent is not null 
--order by 2,3
)
Select *, (RollingPeopleVaccinated/Population)*100
From PopvsVac



-- Another possibility is by using Temp Table
--  to perform Calculation on Partition By in previous query
-- Personal opinion: a bit overkill :-) :-P hehe

DROP Table if exists #PercentPopulationVaccinated
Create Table #PercentPopulationVaccinated
(
Continent nvarchar(255),
Location nvarchar(255),
Date datetime,
Population numeric,
New_vaccinations numeric,
RollingPeopleVaccinated numeric
)

Insert into #PercentPopulationVaccinated
Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations
, SUM(CONVERT(int,vac.new_vaccinations)) OVER (Partition by dea.Location Order by dea.location, dea.Date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths dea
Join PortfolioProject..CovidVaccinations vac
	On dea.location = vac.location
	and dea.date = vac.date
--where dea.continent is not null 
--order by 2,3

Select *, (RollingPeopleVaccinated/Population)*100
From #PercentPopulationVaccinated




-- Creating View to store data for later visualizations
-- may be used in Tableau/PowerBI for easier data importation
Create View PercentPopulationVaccinated as
Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations
, SUM(CONVERT(int,vac.new_vaccinations)) OVER (Partition by dea.Location Order by dea.location, dea.Date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths dea
Join PortfolioProject..CovidVaccinations vac
	On dea.location = vac.location
	and dea.date = vac.date
where dea.continent is not null
