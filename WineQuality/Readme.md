# Wine Quality Data Exploration, Analysis, Linear and Logistic Regression
This is a huge project that I developed for a Data Science course I took during the second semester of 2021 and the first semester of 2022. The code in the notebook is commented in English, however all the written content is still in Portuguese, but I'm planning to translate it some day.

### Contributors
I just want to leave a special thank you for all the members in my group, who definetly made all this possible and from whom I learned so much. Please check their GitHub profile:

### Features to be developed
This project is still in development, there are upcoming updates still to be released. Following are the tasks I plan to implent:

- [x] Data exploration.
- [x] Data cleaning.
- [x] Data viz.
- [x] Linear Regression.
- [x] Logistic Regression.
- [x] Model Evaluation.
- [ ] Notebook translation.

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, you will need a few tools, such as:

- Python, with Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn installed.
- Jupyter notebook, or another platform that allows to edit and vizualize a Python Notebook.

### Credits
The project's task was elaborated by the teacher [Christopher Silva](https://github.com/ChristopherSP).
